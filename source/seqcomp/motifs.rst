Motifs -- short biological sequences
====================================

A motif is a short sequence that occurs multiple times in a DNA, RNA or protein sequence. The phrase is typically applied to sequences that are considered to have some function.

The phrase can be applied quite generally. For instance, the ``"ATG"`` motif corresponds to the start codon of protein coding genes.
