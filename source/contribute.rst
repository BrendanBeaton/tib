How to Contribute
*****************

It's easy for you to contribute to improving these notes. First, while you're reading this as a web-page, the actual document is written in restructuredText_ (a lite-weight markup language) and converted to html using the excellent Sphinx_ project.

To make simple corrections, you probably don't need to deal with the syntax issues. You will, however, need a GitHub account. I strongly encourage you to sign up as yourself (i.e. don't use a student ID) as any contribution you make adds to your reputation -- which matters in the bioinformatics space. To start editing, just click on the "Edit on GitHub" icon (top right of the page) and follow the prompts.

If you have a suggestion for improvement, want to let me know you find something difficult to understand, or you've identified something which you think is incorrect, then please raise an issue_.
