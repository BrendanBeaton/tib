I encourage you to download this `free Python IDE`_ for your personal computer. It is useful for understanding program flow and debugging.

Podcasts
========

These are not explicitly aimed at beginners, but podcasts that I find informative on multiple levels and quite polished. |python_bytes|_, is a weekly 30' podcast with an overview of interesting Python things. |test_n_code|_ is a longer format that covers all things related to testing code -- a critical topic for scientists. |talkpython|_ is a longer format interview of various individuals doing interesting things. Data science is increasingly covered by these podcasts.
